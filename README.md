# Xone Economic Assets Info

## Overview

The repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

## Additional Information

- Projects must be sound, with available information and **non-minimal circulation**.

### Assets App

The Assets web app can be used for most new token additions (GitHub account is needed).

### Quick starter

_You can also use scripts below to help with token submission and validation._

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)
- `make add-token asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Create `info.json` file as asset template.
- `make add-tokenlist asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist.json.
- `make add-tokenlist-extended asset_id=c60_t0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53` -- Adds a token to tokenlist-extended.json.

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.

There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR. Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app and shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.

## Disclaimer

Xone team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Xone team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Xone team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.

Additionally, spam-like behavior, including but not limited to mass distribution of tokens to random addresses will result in the asset being flagged as spam and possible removal from the repository.
